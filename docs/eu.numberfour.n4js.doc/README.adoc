== How to Contribute


All documentation for N4JS is written in AsciiDoc (`.adoc` format) and is processed using a single-source documentation toolchain described in detail below.
The source AsciiDoc documentation is located at the NumberFour N4JS repository at:

``https://github.numberfour.eu/NumberFour/n4js/tree/master/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc/src[n4js/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc/src]``

The N4JS IDE is built using https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven].
The command ``mvn verify`` will trigger the build of the N4JS IDE and target documentation is generated in the following folder:

``https://github.com/NumberFour/n4js/tree/master/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc/target[n4js/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc/target]``

To contribute or improve N4JS help, https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork the N4JS repo], create a pull request with edited or new AsciiDoc files in the source folder and your pull request will be reviewed for inclusion in the distrobution.

== Details on the Maven Build

An XML file in the root of the source folder describes the project being built, its dependencies on external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins.
This XML file, is called ``POM.XML`` (Project Object Model) and is located at

``https://github.com/NumberFour/n4js/blob/master/pom.xml``

The standard convention for building large software projects with Maven is that they are divided into several modules, each with its own POM.
The POM in the root folder points at several modules:

.n4js/pom.xml
[source,xml]
<modules>
    <module>releng</module>
    <module>plugins</module>
    <module>testhelpers</module>
    <module>features</module>
    <module>docs</module>
    <module>tools</module>
</modules>

Each module contains a POM that can inherit attributes from the 'parent' and specify further settings for the build of its particular module.
If we navigate to the docs module at ``n4js/docs/``, we can see that the contained POM specifies a parent (``n4js/pom.xml``) and a nested module (``eu.numberfour.n4js.doc``) which is where our documentation source and target live:

.n4js/docs/pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <relativePath>../pom.xml</relativePath>
</parent>

<modules>
    <module>eu.numberfour.n4js.doc</module>
</modules>
----

=== N4JS Documentation Plugin

The N4JS documentation plugin is located at ``n4js/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc`` whose contents resemble the following:

[source]
n4js/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc/
├── build.properties
├── help-pages.txt
├── plugin.xml
├── pom.xml
├── src

* **pom.xml** - Describes the build of the ``eu.numberfour.n4js.doc`` plugin.
* **plugin.xml** - Describes how the plugin extends the platform, how it implements functionality.
* **help-pages.txt** - A list containing the paths of the **target** HTML files. This is used to generate the **toc.xml**.
* **toc.xml** - Table Of Contents; contains a structured index of the help pages so they may be registered online or within the N4JS IDE
* **build.properties** - Describes which items in the root folder are to be included in the N4JS IDE build

=== Generating N4JS IDE Help

The Eclipse Help bundled with the N4JS IDE is essentially HTML files accompanied by a ``toc.xml`` that lists the structure of these help files.
In the Maven build, the POM at ``n4js/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc/pom.xml`` is configured to execute these plugins in the following order:

. The ``asciidoctor-maven-plugin`` converts source AsciiDoc files (``src`` folder) to HTML (``target`` folder).
. The ``geneclipsetoc-maven-plugin`` scans the generated HTML files in the ``target`` folder and creates the ``toc.xml``

The geneclipsetoc-maven-plugin searches for headings (<h1> etc.) in the generated HTML and creates a structured toc file based on this hierarchy that the N4JS IDE can index.

In this ``pom.xml``, the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin[AsciiDoctor Maven Plugin] is invoked to convert our source ``.adoc`` files to the required output.

A single execution of the ``asciidoctor-maven-plugin`` to convert our source files to HTML in the ``generate-resources`` phase of a Maven build looks like the following:

[source,xml]
<execution>
    <id>asciidoc-to-html</id>
    <phase>generate-resources</phase>
    <goals>
        <goal>process-asciidoc</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
        <sourceDirectory>src/</sourceDirectory>
        <imagesdir>images</imagesdir>
        <preserveDirectories>true</preserveDirectories>
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/html</outputDirectory>
        <backend>html5</backend>
        <sourceHighlighter>coderay</sourceHighlighter>
        <attributes>
            <toc>left</toc>
            <icons>font</icons>
            <sectanchors>true</sectanchors>
            <idprefix/>
            <idseparator>-</idseparator>
            <docinfo1>false</docinfo1>
        </attributes>
    </configuration>
</execution>

These executions can then be run consecutively with different backends, target folders and with specific attributes that will override those in the headers of the source ``.adoc`` files.

For generating PDF and EPUB from the source AsciiDoc files, the addition of the following dependencies are required in the ``asciidoctor-maven-plugin``:

[source,xml]
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
	<artifactId>asciidoctorj-pdf</artifactId>
	<version>${asciidoctorj.pdf.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
	<artifactId>asciidoctorj-epub3</artifactId>
	<version>${asciidoctor-epub3.version}</version>
</dependency>



==== The toc.xml

In order to avoid polluting the Maven POM, we use a help-pages.txt file (located at ``n4js/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc/help-pages.txt``) to point the ``geneclipsetoc`` plugin at the correct paths of the generated HTML files.

A sample configuration of the geneclipsetoc plugin looks like the following:

[source,xml]
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.bsiag.geneclipsetoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>geneclipsetoc-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>geneclipsetoc</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <sourceFolder>${basedir}</sourceFolder>
                <pagesListFile>help-pages.txt</pagesListFile>
                <outputTocFile>toc.xml</outputTocFile>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>

IMPORTANT: The help-pages.txt file is handwritten with the target HTML paths.
If any resources in the documentation ``src`` folder are renamed, moved or added, the ``help-pages.txt`` file must be updated with the **target** html paths. This process will be automated in future.


== About AsciiDoc & AsciiDoctor

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/#what-is-asciidoc[**AsciiDoc**] is a syntax and file format (``.adoc``).

http://asciidoctor.org/[**AsciiDoc__tor__**] is the associated toolchain for converting and processing AsciiDoc files.
It is written in Ruby and is published to https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor[RubyGems.org].

=== AsciiDoc Writing Tips & Resources

AsciiDoc files can be written in any text editor and should (for our build) be saved with the ``.adoc`` extension.
The following are two useful guides for writing AsciiDoc:

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[AsciiDoctor User Manual]


=== Tools

For previewing content as you are writing:

https://asciidoclive.com/[AsciiDocLive] - Free online AsciiDoc editor. Can save to Dropbox or Google Drive.

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia?hl=en[Asciidoctor.js Live Preview] - Chrome browser plugin (**recommended**).

NOTE: It can happen that occasionally, some features (text alignment in non-trivial tables, for instance) may not render exactly as expected in the above Live Preview for chrome.
If the syntax looks correct but the preview displays your content incorrectly, render to .html in the command line with AsciiDoctor.

For **Sublime Text** Users:

* https://packagecontrol.io/packages/OmniMarkupPreviewer[Omni Markup Previewer] - kbd:[Cmd+o] when editing opens a live browser preview.

* https://github.com/asciidoctor/sublimetext-asciidoc[Sublime Text AsciiDoc Package] - Syntax highlighting, snippets, keymaps and more.

Converting from another Markdown/Markup language:

* https://github.com/opendevise/kramdown-asciidoc[Kramdown] - Convert existing GitHub Flavoured Markdown (``.md``) to AsciiDoc (``.adoc``).

* http://pandoc.org/[Pandoc] - A universal document converter

=== Converting with AsciiDoctor

AsciiDoctor can be invoked from the command line to convert ``.adoc`` plain text to a number of file formats. This can be tested locally with the AsciiDoctor RubyGem:

* AsciiDoctor http://asciidoctor.org/#installation[Installation instructions]

The processor generates the output format using a converter which is mapped to the name of a backend.
You specify the backend using the -b (--backend) command line option or backend API option.
The built-in converters are mapped to the following backend names:

|===
| Backend 3+^| Description
| **html** (or **html5**) 3+| HTML5, styled with CSS3 (default).
| **xhtml** (or **xhtml5**) 3+| The XHTML variant of the output from html5.
| **docbook** (or **docbook5**) 3+| DocBook 5.0 XML.0.

| **docbook45**
3+| DocBook 4.5 XML.

| **manpage**
3+|Manual pages for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

|===

Asciidoctor also has several add-on converters, which can be plugged in by adding the appropriate library to the runtime path (e.g., -r asciidoctor-pdf). These converters are mapped to the following backend names:

|===
| Backend 3+^| Description
|**pdf**
3+|PDF, a portable document format. **Requires the asciidoctor-pdf gem**.

|**epub3**
3+|EPUB3, a distribution and interchange format standard for digital publications and documents. **Requires the asciidoctor-epub3 gem**.

|**latex**
3+|LaTeX, a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. **Requires the asciidoctor-latex gem**.

|**mallard**
3+|Mallard 1.0 XML. **Requires the asciidoctor-mallard gem** (not yet released).
|===

=== Customising Processed Output Per Format

Some of the documentation in the ``src`` folder contains http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#conditional-preprocessor-directives[Conditional Preprocessor Directives]. The ``ide-setup.adoc`` file located at ``n4js/docs/eu.numberfour.n4js.doc/src/docs/documentation/ide-setup.adoc`` contains the following:

[source,asciidoc]
\ifdef::backend-html5[]
image::runhello.gif[]

Where the animated .gif is embedded/processed in the target **only if the html5** backend is used.

This presents the opportunity for custom content per document type (i.e. html header/footer)

== Developing AsciiDoc

There are several ports of AsciiDoctor, notably:

* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[AsciiDoctor.js] - A JavaScript port of AsciiDoctor

[quote]
The asciidoctor.js script can be run on any JavaScript platform, including Node.js, Nashorn and, of course, a web browser.


* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[AsciidoctorJ] - Java bindings for AsciiDoctor

[quote]
AsciidoctorJ is the official library for running Asciidoctor on the JVM.
Using AsciidoctorJ, you can convert AsciiDoc content or analyze the structure of a parsed AsciiDoc document from Java and other JVM languages.
